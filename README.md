<!-- TO DO: add more details about me later -->
## About me
I'm a C# Developer with 10+ years of experience in developing Unity Games, Engine Tools and Frameworks.

Video Games got me into programming. I love video games because they can teach you a lot while being interactive and entertaining at the same tinme.
At some point, I was enjoying them for more than what they show you.
I was wondering how the hell did they do this or that.

<!-- I graduated from SAE Institute Munich where I got my Diploma in Games Programming. After finishing that I extended my degree by Bachelor of Science. -->
