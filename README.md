<!-- TO DO: add more details about me later -->
## About me
I'm a C# Developer with 10+ years of experience in developing Unity Games, Engine Tools and Frameworks.

<!-- Video Games got me into programming. I love video games because they can teach you a lot while being interactive and entertaining at the same time.
At some point, I was enjoying them for more than what they show you.
I was wondering how the hell did they do this or that.

<!-- I graduated from SAE Institute Munich where I got my Diploma in Games Programming. Afterwards I extended my degree by Bachelor of Science. -->

<!-- I love talking about and discussing ideas for projects. Problem solving and finding the best (and/or quickest) solution is one of my passions.
Especially with at least one more person or a full team because you get more than one point of view and can spiral down to the right solution. 
If you want to discuss anything about your project and want a second opinion, hit me up :) -->
